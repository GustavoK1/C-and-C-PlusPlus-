# C-and-C-PlusPlus
My C and C++ projects

I'm lerning and aprimoring my C and C++ knowledge, so while i'm doing i will register all my projects that i'm developing day-a-day. 
  with that i can follow my progress and plan what i have to take more attencion. Otherwise, it could be part of my curriculum and help me get frond-end job. 
  
By now, that's what i wanna do!  Thank you for reading! :D  ass: Gustavo Henrique Klinger Amadi.
